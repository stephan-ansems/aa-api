    The Active Ants Shop API was made to replace the old Novulo Webservice. Much of the old
    functionality has been kept, but there have been quite a few changes. One of them is the conversion
    to JSON. This document will cover all different calls you can perform in as much detail as possible. For
    each operation we will define which fields are needed to use the API, and provide you with the URL
    to use for your JSON requests.
